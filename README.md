# test-drive
My first try on implementing a browser game in the style of the old amiga game Spirit Of Adventure.

Currently some images are painted on a canvas, prototype-functions for playing audio and going fullscreen exist.
A mechanism for world map loading is implemented;

Next: 
- mapping and drawing the wall textures as derived from the parties' position and the world map
- keyboard events for navigating through the world map
- collision detection
- tidying up javascript by introducing a client-framework
