# test-drive
My first try on implementing a browser game in the style of the old amiga game 'Spirit Of Adventure' by Attic.

Currently some images are painted on a canvas, prototype-functions for playing audio and going fullscreen exist.
A mechanism for world map loading is implemented;

Painting the world in pseudo 3d is near completion!
Started to implement cursor controls for moving around.

Using require.js for better code modularization.

Next: 
- collision detection
- some improvements on world painting
